# Example library using TypeScript

This is a quick exploration of what it takes to write a library using
TypeScript. Not much it seems!

Simply run `npm run build` or `tsc` to compile.

The TypeScript-files `.ts` in `src/` will be compiled into `dist` as
JavaScript-files `.js` and separate `.d.ts` type-declaration files.

Note that I haven't tried publishing this to npm or verified if there are more
things to do first.
